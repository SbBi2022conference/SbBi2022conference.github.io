## 18 to 20 May 2022 in Banská Štiavnica.
#### This conference will bring together geoscientists, chemists, and materials scientists interested in the cycling of antimony and bismuth in nature, including man-made and engineered systems. Spatial scales range from planetary cycling to speciation and partitioning on micro- to nanoscale. Physical conditions span the range from conditions in the deep Earth to the surface of the Earth, including inorganic, organic, and biological processes. We will address questions of mobility of antimony and bismuth in various geochemical compartments, such as rocks, soils, water, and air. Fate of the elements during weathering will be discussed and interrogated. The goal of the conference is to establish the state of current knowledge and to identify promising venues that could help to enhance our understanding of how these elements behave, where do they come from and where are they heading.
