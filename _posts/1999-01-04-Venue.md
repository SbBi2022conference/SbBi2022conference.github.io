# Venue
Banská Štiavnica is a town in central Slovakia, in the middle of an immense caldera created by the collapse of an ancient volcano. Its fate has been closely linked to the exploitation of its abundant resources of silver ore. It is a completely preserved medieval town, which was proclaimed by the UNESCO to be a World Heritage Site. The Conference will be held in the town's [New Castle](https://www.muzeumbs.sk/en/new-castle).
